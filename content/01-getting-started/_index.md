### Chapter 1

# Getting Started

In this section we will be setting up a project repository for application development using Directus.
We will cover how to set up a multi-workspace project and how to run that project in both development situations and in production.

Throughout this guide I will be using [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) as my package manager but it should also work fine with npm.
